# Lab-2-Tunley-Part-1

## Overview

In this lab you'll build an app that displays tracks from the iTunes API and allows users to get more details about a specific track by tapping the track to present a detail view showing more information about the track.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
By the end of this lab you will be able to...

- [x] Use table views and custom cells in your apps to display a list of data to the user.
- [x] Use hardcoded data models to power their appâ€™s UI

## Features
### Required Features

- [x] View a list of tracks with their title, artist and album cover in a table view using custom table view cells.
- [x] For this part of the project weâ€™ll be using hardcoded Track data models since the goal is to focus on navigation and table views. Weâ€™ll add networking in the next unit.
- [x] Users should be able to view the UI in any screen size and orientation.
- [x] For loading the track album cover, we'll use Nuke, a 3rd party image loading library installed via SPM.
- [x] Tapping on a track takes the user to detail screen where they can view more information about it (artist, album, etc.).
